# Robot-Learning-Library

Robot control with learning methods is hard in general, we open-source the code here for boosting our research and development.

## Contents:
What we will provide in this repository:
* Robot learning environments: 
  * Based on MuJoCo;
  * Based on Isaac Sim;

* Basic robotic control:
  * Inverse kinematics;
  * Trajectory generation;
  * System identification;

* Learning methods:
  * Domain randomizationï¼›
  * A deep RL library with PyTorch (or JAX, to be determined);
  * Imitation learning;
  * Meta-learning across tasks;
 
* Real robot control:
  * ROS;

* Additional:
  * Tactile sensory;

## Projects:
There is a list of project using these repository:
* [Sim-to-Real Transfer for Robotic Manipulation with Tactile Sensory Zihan Ding, Ya-Yen Tsai, Wang Wei Lee, Bidan Huang (IROS 2021)](https://github.com/quantumiracle/Robotic_Door_Opening_with_Tactile_Simulation)
* [Not Only Domain Randomization: Universal Policy with Embedding System Identification.](https://github.com/quantumiracle/UPESI)
